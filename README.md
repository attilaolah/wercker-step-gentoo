root privileges.

This step is meant to be used with the [`gentoo`][1] box or one of its derived
boxes.

## Usage

build:
  steps:
    - attilaolah/gentoo:
        command: echo "This is a command."
    - attilaolah/gentoo:
        command: |
          echo "This is a multi-line command.
          echo "It will all be executed by a single call to 'sh -c'."
```
